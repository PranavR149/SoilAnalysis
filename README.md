# Project Description
The Soil Analysis Using Machine Learning project aimed to evaluate soil health and predict critical soil parameters using advanced machine learning techniques. A comprehensive dataset was gathered from diverse sources, including remote sensing satellites, ground sensors, surveys, radars, and weather sensors. This dataset encompassed essential soil parameters such as temperature, moisture, pH, carbon, and nitrogen, along with weather variables like atmospheric temperature, precipitation, humidity, dewpoint, and surface pressure. Additionally, detailed information on soil types, crops, and farmlands within specific zip codes in Fresno County was collected for the period spanning January 1, 1987, to December 31, 2022.

After data acquisition, the datasets were merged and meticulously preprocessed to ensure reliability. Special attention was given to identifying and mitigating the impact of outliers using logarithmic transformations. A robust Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to derive meaningful insights. Correlation heatmaps revealed relationships between positively and negatively correlated features, pairwise scatter plots showcased interactions between variables, histograms illustrated data distribution, and time-series visualizations highlighted seasonal and annual trends in the data.

To predict the soil parameters—temperature, moisture, pH, carbon, and nitrogen—eight machine learning models were implemented, including ARIMA, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost, LSTM, and an innovative hybrid model combining LSTM with Random Forest. The dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets in an 80:10:10 ratio. These models provided robust predictions and were instrumental in analyzing trends and variations across time.

The findings revealed that soil temperature and soil moisture are significantly influenced by weather conditions, while carbon, nitrogen, and pH levels remain relatively stationary over shorter periods but exhibit long-term changes. Carbon and nitrogen levels showed gradual depletion over the years, likely due to extensive cultivation, microbial activities, and reduced soil replenishment. Similarly, pH levels demonstrated increasing acidity, which may be attributed to intensive farming practices, microbial interactions, and the quality of pesticides used.

To enhance usability, an interactive GUI was developed as part of the project. This tool allows users to view geospatial maps where clicking on location pins reveals region-specific weather details, soil types, and crops grown. A legend ensures intuitive understanding of the map. The GUI also features interactive time-series graphs to display predicted trends for soil parameters such as temperature, moisture, pH, carbon, and nitrogen. Additionally, pie charts present the percentage distribution of crops and soil types, while a tabular format provides daily prediction values for soil parameters. Users can filter the data by zip code or customize date ranges, offering a seamless exploration experience.

In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive assessment of soil health across farmlands in Fresno County, offering valuable insights for farmers and stakeholders. By identifying trends in soil and weather parameters, it enables data-driven decisions to sustain agricultural productivity and soil quality. The integration of predictive modeling with an interactive GUI ensures accessibility and utility, making this project a practical tool for real-world agricultural analysis.
